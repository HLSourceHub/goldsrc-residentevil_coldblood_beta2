TO: Operations managers, senior security staff
RE:  Contamination issues

------------------------------

Pending further investigation, action must be taken concerning the current
safeguards in place.  The new specimens and materials being held in 
your section require a more secure environment than anything created 
by previous company research projects.  

Following the transfer of specimens from batch # 015 35510 0135v15 there 
were 7 injuries and 3 deaths reported with contamination being the primary 
cause for the incident.  Four other incidents are on file and pending investigation. 

A team from LP will be dispatched to assess the viability of all operations in your 
facility.  They are to be given access to all areas, and shall not be hindered in any 
way as they conduct their investigation.  Non-compliance will result in disciplinary 
action up to and including termination.  

Sincerely,

LP Management
