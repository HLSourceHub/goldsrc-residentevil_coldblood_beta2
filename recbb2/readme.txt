Resident Evil: Cold Blood is a co-operative set in the world of Resident Evil™
Players will fight together to survive the horrific terrors of the infamous “Raccoon City incident”, battling hideous mutants and walking, festering corpses. Featuring an array of “trademark” elements from the games, such as the element of puzzle solving intertwined with desperate combat, as well as a gratuitous amount of violence and gore. Explicit violence and gore. Welcome to RE:CB – Beta 2.

1)	Getting Started

To play Resident Evil: Cold Blood, you must have a working copy of Half-Life, installed to an authentic Steam account. We cannot stress that enough. THIS IS A STEAM MOD.  You may find a download for Steam at 

http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=getsteamnow 

The following system is most likely the minimum system requirements to play RE: CB:

1.5 GHZ Processor
512 MB RAM
OpenGL compatible Graphics Card with at least 32MB memory
2 GB of free Hard-Drive space

NOTE: YOU MUST BE IN OPENGL VIDEO MODE TO PLAY THIS MOD.


2)	How to Install
Most people are clueless when it comes to installing Steam mods. You  do NOT install the mod files to any directory you like. You MUST install the mod folder (recbb2] to your Steam/Steamapps/youremail@site.com/half-life folder, so that you are left with the following path:

Steam/Steamapps/youremail@site.com/half-life/recbb2

with the “models/dlls/cl_dlls/etc” folders inside the “recbb2” directory. The installer should automatically pick the right folder to install to. Don’t mess with it if it does.

3)	So what’s new?
Short answer? Well, basically EVERYTHING.  Here’s a short but not complete list:

Iron sights
Twenty Three weapons
Eighteen unique monsters
8 playable characters, each with their own stats and abilities
Minigame modes – Play as a Crimson Head and hunt down your friends!
Fifteen maps – More coming VERY soon!
Enhanced monster animations
Enhanced monster AI
Enhanced monster visuals
Command menu for performing various actions, such as using a first aid spray, mixing some herbs or applying a bandage
Resident Evil 4 style over-the-shoulder camera, complete with crosshair, with the ability to seamlessly switch between first and third person at the touch of a button ingame
Watch out for monsters – clawed nasties can slice your head off, while players watch your detached head roll across the floor
Extended ab-lib commands – Tell players you need ammo, health or simply give your opinion on whether or not the army should have arrived by now
Tap your “struggle” key to push those nasty grabbing zombies off of you
Improved visuals and technical design


4)	If I die, do I stay dead?
No. You bitched and complained, we listened. Ink ribbons are spread generously around the levels. If you die, you use an ink ribbon to respawn (an automatic process). All players start with 1 ribbon and may carry a maximum of three. If you lose all your ribbons and die, it’s still not final. However, you will have to spectate for a certain amount of time, set by the admin, and then you may respawn again. The default time is 15 seconds.
   
5)	How do I use the command menu?
Very simple. Go into “options” and set your preferred controls there. Then press and hold your command menu key. A mouse cursor should appear, allowing you to click your desired choices.

6)	How did I stop zombies that are biting me?
2 ways. You can wait for your character to automatically push them off or you can greatly speed up the process by tapping the struggle key as fast as you can. It WILL save your life

7)	Where are the missing maps? Forest Trail? Labs?
They’re being released soon, probably around New Year.

8)	What’s this in the map briefing? “CHARACTERS REQUIRED : Tim – Otto”
As mentioned before, characters have their own unique abilities. Sometimes they come into play with the maps, with only somebody playing as the required character allowing the team to progress. You can see who’s playing as who so that you may choose a required character by pressing your “show scores” button whilst the character selection menu is open.

ADMINS: If you do not want this feature in your servers, set “mp_allplayersmode” to 0. This will allow all players to do any character specific action in the map.

9)	How do I use iron sights?
Secondary attack. Aim up the sights with your target. Fire.

10)	But some guns have other secondary attacks!
That is correct. In that instance, you will have to aim. However, if you really need a crosshair, go into third person.

11)	 Can I make my own map for RE: CB?
Yes, of course! The FGD will be made available to the public very soon. Probably around New Year. The FGD will come with documentation on the new entities.

12)	 I’ve discovered a bug!
Oops, sorry. Guess that’s why it’s still a beta. Report any REAL bugs you find on the forums : www.recoldblood.com/forum

13)	 I need more info and my question wasn’t answered here! >=(
Simple solution. Go on the forums and post your problem. Can’t be arsed to write anymore anyway.
