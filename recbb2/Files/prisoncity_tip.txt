My last note...

All we had to do was to run, run, run and run.
We didn't have a chance against those monsters. None. Our ammo ran out on the way here.
My friend died and now I'm here, all alone... What am I supposed to do?
I'll probably just sit here and enjoy my last minutes before I shoot myself with my last shot.

Hope you can sort this out, with this terror. Good bye world.
