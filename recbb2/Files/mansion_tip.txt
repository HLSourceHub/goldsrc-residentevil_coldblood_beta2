Well, it looks like another boat has been taken from the outside docks. I've asked the
neighbours about it and they claim they didn't see or hear anything. Maybe they're
lying... I moved my last boat around to the back docks. It's more secluded there, but
a real pain if I want to go fishing! Ah well, John says he's caught a few big ones there
before, maybe I'll get lucky. That reminds me, I mustn't forget to buy some new fencing
in town this weekend. I'll need to cut a shortcut through the trees to get to my new
makeshift dock...
