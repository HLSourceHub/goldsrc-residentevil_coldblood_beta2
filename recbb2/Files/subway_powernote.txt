Notes:

Frank, this isn't the main generator switch, and that needs to
be addressed to the rest of your employees. This switch is for
the SECONDARY power source. Killing this will NOT kill all power
in the event of an emergency, although it will shut down localised
power for the tracks, as well as lights wired to the old circuit
system. Use this in the following situations:

- Fatality on the railway or injury
- Workers need to navigate the local track area
- Emergency situation where train collision is possible

Do NOT use in a terrorist alert.
