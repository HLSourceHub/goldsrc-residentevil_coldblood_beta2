Dear new workers,

Be ware that the power box need to be in center of the elevator, or
else it will probably make the elevator get stuck. This is because
the power box heavy weight need to be in center of the elevator to balance
the weight in order to not make it get stuck. If you are having trouble
with it, try again by moving back down with the elevator, hopefully
that will make the weight balance again.
