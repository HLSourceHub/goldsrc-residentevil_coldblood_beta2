Alright, we've got the gas canister sorted out, I sure hope Mike is right
about it being pressurised enough so that it might destroy that door. Kinda
sad that we're resorting to such measures, but hell... we're desperate. 

Hmm, I wonder if Sam's managed to find anything to pierce it? I'm thinking
that a gunshot might just blow the whole thing up...
