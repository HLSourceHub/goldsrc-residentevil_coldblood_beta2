David,

This god damned water has been leaking into the generator
area for some weeks now, and now it's flooded. Not to
mention it's dangerous as hell. If you'd actually bothered
to fix it when we mentioned it last month, then we probably
wouldn't be having these electrical flickering issues.
It needs your attention ASAP, as the water is now most likely
conducting electricity from the main fuse. I know you get off
work early on a Tuesday, but it's an emergency. Come down about
6:30ish.

Alan.
