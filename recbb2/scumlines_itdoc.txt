SUBJECT :   ___Security room __Passwords.
FROM    :        IT DEPT. 
 
The database containing all staff login information was lost 
when the relay overload damaged the server.  A new server 
has been installed and the most recent backup of the database 
has been uploaded to minimize downtime.  

If you discover any account which had previously been disabled 
or removed please notify a member of the IT staff immediately as 
this will pose a security risk.

As a reminder, the global pass code to gain access to the security 
room has been changed to 91 72059.  A new pass code will be 
assigned in 90 days.  Make certain that all security staff are notified 
before the old pass code is disabled.
